    <title>Wavelength of absorption of KMnO4 : Beer's Law</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>To determine maximum wavelength of absorption of KMnO4, verify Beer's Law and find unknown concentration in given sample</h1>
    <h2>Prior Concepts :</h2>
        <p>Electromagnetic radiation, particle and wave like nature of radiation, absorption and transmission of radiation by substanc, frequency and wavelength of light</p>
    <h2>New Concept :</h2>
        <p>Proposition 1: Colorimetry deals with the measurement of color intensity. The color of a substance is due to absorbance of light waves of certain wavelengths. 
        If a solution does not absorb light, it is transparent and colorless. If it absorbs light completely it is completely black.</p>
        <!-- Image -->
        <p>Proposition 2: According to Beer's law absorption of radiation by a solution is directly proportional to the concentration of the solution. Hence Beer's law can be used to determine the concentration of unknown solution.
        The advantage of colorimetric analysis is that, it requires much less time, it is more accurate than chemical analysis and can determine low concentration (less than 2%). 
        Where A = Absorption & C = Concentration.</p>

    <h3>Fundamental Laws Of Colorimetry</h3>
        <p>When light (monochromatic or heterochromatic) isincident upon a homogenous medium, a part of the radiant power of the incident light (Po) is reflected (Pr) a part is absorbed by the medium (Pa) and the remainder is transmitted (Pt)
        <br><br>Po = Pa + Pt + Pr<br>Where,<br>Po = Radiant power of incident light<br>Pr = Radiant power of reflected light<br>Pa = Radiant power of absorbed light<br>Pt = Radiant power of transmitted light</p>
        <p>Colorimetry is based on following fundamental law<br>1. Lambert's Law &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp & &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 2. Beer's Law<br>The combined form of these laws is called Beer-Lambert's Law.<br></p>
    <h3>Beer's Law</h3>
        <p>This law can be stated as follows :<br><br>"When a beam of monochromatic light is allowed to pass through a transparent medium, the rate of decrease of radiant power with the concentration of the medium is directly proportional to the radiant power i.e. 
        absorbance of the medium is directly proportional to the concentration of the solution."</p>
    <h3>Lambert's Law</h3>
        <p> This law can be stated as follows:<br><br>"When a beam of monochromatic light tis allowed to pass through a transparent medium, the rate of decrease of radiant power with the thickness of the medium 
        is directly proportional to the radiant power i.e. absorbance of the medium is directly proportional to the thickness of the medium or the path of length.</p>
    <h3>Beer-Lambert's Law :</h3>
        <p>The Lambert's Law states that,The Lambert's Law states that,<br>A = a x b x C<br><br> Thus the Beer-Lambert's Law can be defined as: 
        <br>"When a beam of monochromatic light is allowed to pass through a transparent medium, the absorption of the medium is directly proportional t to the thickness and concentration of the medium.<br><br> 
        When the concentration is expressed in gm/lit and thickness in cm, the constant in above equation is called as molar absorptive and is expressed by symbol "a"
        <br>Thus<br> A= a x b x C
        <br><br>When the concentration is expressed in mol/lit and thickness in cm, the constant in the above equation is called as molar absorptivity and represented by the symbol "e"
        <br>A = e x b x C<br>
        Thus, A = e, when b = 1 cm and C = 1 mol/lit<br><br><br>
        The molar absorptivity is the absorbance of the solution measured in a cell of one centimeter thickness with concentration of one mole per litre. It is a constant independent of concentration, length of the path and radiant power of incident light.</p>
        <p>The Beer-Lambers law can be also stated as -<br><br>"For the given system and the thickness of the medium, the absorbance of the solution is directly proportional to the concentration of absorbing species."</p>
