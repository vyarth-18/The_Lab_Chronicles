    TITRATION OF STRONG ACID VS. STRONG BASE USING A CONDUCTIVITY METER AND TO DETERMINE THE STRENGTH OF THE ACID
</h1>
<h2 style="font-family: Comic Sans MS, sans-serif;">Prior Concepts:</h2>
<p> Conductance, resistance, variation in conductance w.r.t concentration. Weak and strong acids-bases.</p>
<h2 style="font-family: Comic Sans MS, sans-serif;"> New Concepts:</h2>
<p> Proposition 1: The principle of conductometric titration is based on the fact that during titration, 
one of the ion is replaced by the other and invariably these two ions differ in the
 ionic conductance with the result that conductivity of the solution varies during the titration.</p>
 <p> Proposition 2: The equivalence point is located graphically by plotting change in conductance as 
 function of the volume of titrant is added.</p>
 <h2 style="font-family: Comic Sans MS, sans-serif;"> Information Input:</h2>
 <p>1. When the mixture of CH3COOH and HCL is titrated against NaOH,HCL being the strong acid will neutralise first followed by CH3COOH.</p>
 <p>2. Neutralisation of CH3COOH(weak acid) will commence only after the complete neutralisation of HCL.</p>
 <p>3. The Conductance titration curve is marked by two breaks, the first one corresponds to
 neutralisation of HCL and second one to that of CH3COOH.</p>
 <p>4. Let V1 and V2 mL be the volume of alkali corresponding to first and second breaks respectively.</p>
 <p>        V1 mL of NaOH=HCL , V2 mL of NaOH=HCL+CH3COOH </p>
 <p>        Hence,<V2-V1>mL of NaOH=CH3COOH </P>

<h3 style="font-family: Comic Sans MS, sans-serif;">Viva Voice:(General Knowledge on the experiement)</h3>
<h4 style="font-family:Comic Sans MS, sans-serif;">Q1)Define conductance, specific conductance and equivalence conduction.</h4>
<p>Answer:1. Conductance (G):</p>
<p>  Definition: Conductance is the ability of a material to allow the flow of electric current. It is the reciprocal of resistance.</p>
<p>  Formula: G=1/R</p>
<p>  where,G is conductance and R is resistance. </p>
<p>  Unit: Siemens (S), which is equivalent to Œ© ^‚àí1(inverse ohm)</p>
<p>  Dependence: It depends on the material's properties, geometry (length and cross-sectional area), and the temperature of the conductor.</p>
<p>2)Specific Conductance(Œ∫):
Definition: Also known as conductivity, specific conductance is the measure of a material's ability to conduct electricity, considering its intrinsic properties, without reference to its size or shape.</p>
<p>Formula-k=1/œÅ</p>
<p>where ,ùúÖ is specific conductance and ùúå is resistivity.</p>
<p>Unit: Siemens per meter (S¬∑m^-1)</p>
<p>Dependence: It is a characteristic of the material and varies with temperature.</p>
<p>3. Equivalent Conductance(Œõeq):</p>	
<p>Definition: Equivalent conductance is the conductance of a solution containing one gram equivalent of an electrolyte, when placed between electrodes that are one unit length apart and have a unit cross-sectional area.
</p>
<p>Formula:Œõeq=Œ∫*1000/C</p>
<p>where, Œõeq is equivalent conductance, ùúÖ is specific conductance, and ùê∂ is the concentration of the electrolyte in gram equivalents per liter.</p>
<p>Unit: Siemens square centimeter per equivalent</p>
<p>Dependence: It depends on the concentration of the electrolyte and the temperature of the solution. It generally increases as the concentration decreases due to reduced ionic interactions.</p>
<h4 style="font-family:Comic Sans MS, sans-serif;">Q2) Explain the nature of graph of conductometric titration of mixture of acids Vs strong base in terms of mobility of ions.</h4>
<p>Answer:The graph starts with high conduction,due to presence of H+ ions decrease and Na+ ions increase which have comparatively less mobility.
Hence the slope is observed after equivalent point, graph was increased.
<h4 style="font-family:Comic Sans MS, sans-serif;">Q3) 	 Discuss the construction of electrode used for the conductometric titration.</h4>
<p>Answer:Electrodes for conductometric titration typically consist of a conductivity cell made up of materials like platinum, stainless stell or graphite
sheets kept at a certain distance for accurate conductivity calculations.</p>
<h4 style="font-family:Comic Sans MS, sans-serif;">Q4)What is the unit of conductance. Specific conductance, Equivalent conductance, cell constant?</h4>
<p>Answer:Unit of conductance: Siemens(S) and 1S=1ohm^-1</p>
<p> Unit of Specific Conductance:siemens per meter(S m^-1)</p>
<p>Unit of Equivalent Conductance:Siemens meter squared per equivalent(S m^2 eq^-1)</p>
<p>Unit of Cell Constant:per meter (m^-1),For practical laboratory use, it is often expressed in cm^-1</p>
<h4 style="font-family:Comic Sans MS, sans-serif;">Q5)Give any two importance of conductometric titrations.</h4>
<p>Answer:1)No Need for Indicators:In conductometric titrations, the endpoint of the titration is determined by measuring changes in the electrical conductivity
 of the solution, not by visual indicators. This is especially useful when the reaction
 does not produce a suitable color change or when it is difficult to select a proper indicator. For instance, in acid-base titrations involving weak
 acids or bases, a suitable indicator may not exist, but conductometric titrations can still provide accurate results.</p>
 <p>2) Applicable to Turbid or Colored Solutions:Conductometric titrations can be performed on turbid or colored solutions where conventional visual methods, like pH indicators, may be ineffective. The conductivity measurement is not 
 affected by the presence of color or opacity in the solution, allowing accurate titration results in a wide range of chemical systems, such as precipitation and
 redox reactions, where the solution's appearance may change in complex ways.</p>
 <h4 style="font-family:Comic Sans MS, sans-serif;">Q6)What is effect of dilution on equivalent¬†conductance?</h4>
 <p>Answer:1. Increased Ion Mobility-As the solution is diluted, the concentration of ions decreases, reducing interionic interactions (e.g., ion-ion attraction or shielding effects). 
 This allows the ions to move more freely under the influence of an electric field,
 thereby increasing their mobility and, consequently, the equivalent conductance.</p>
 <p>2. Complete Ionization of Weak Electrolytes-For weak electrolytes, such as acetic acid, dilution promotes further ionization according to Le Chatelier's Principle. At higher concentrations, weak electrolytes are only partially ionized, but as the solution is diluted,
 the degree of ionization increases, leading to more charge carriers and a higher</p>
