<p><b>1.0 Title:</b>: To determine dissociation constant of weak acid using pH meter</p>
    
<p><b>2.0 Prior Concepts</b>:  Moles, Molarity, Normality, concentration of H and OH, pH, POH, pKa, pKb. Concept of strong and weak acids and bases.</p>
   
<p><b>3.0 New Concept: Proposition 1:</b></p>
  
<b>pH metric Titration </b>:- Study of pH-metric titration of Stong acid against strong base using pH-meter without use of any indicators.
<p><b>Concept structure:</b></p>
  

<p><b>Proposition 2:</b> Nature of graph depends on the fact that
<p> i)The pH increases slowly at first because the pH scale is logarithmic, which means that a pH of 1 will have 10 times the hydronium ion concentration than a pH of 2. Thus, as the hydronium ion is initally removed, it takes a lot of base to change its concentration by a factor of 10.</p>
 
<p> ii)At end point complete neutralization of acid, pH suddenly increases because near the equivalence point, a change of a factor of 10 occurs very quickly, which is why the graph is extremely steep at this point.</p>
 
<p> iii)After end point, again mild increase in pH because as the hydronium ion concentration becomes very low, it will again take a lot of base to increase the hydroxide ion concentration by 10 fold to change the pH significantly.</p>
<p><b>Concept structure:</b></p>
  
<p><b>4.0 Learning Objective:</b></p>
 
<p><b>4.1 Intellectual skills:</b> </p>
 
<p>a) To understand the pH-metry an electro analytical technique to study pH-metric titration.</p>
<p> b) To understand theory behind titration between strong base Vs strong acid .</p>
<p>c) To understand concept of determining equivalence point by using pH-meter and to calculate strength of unknown acid.</p>
<p><b>4.2 Motor skills:</b> </p>
 
<p>a) Ability to standardize pH-meter using standard buffer solution. </p>
 
<p>b) Ability to handle glass electrode.</p>
 
<p>c) Ability to perform titration using burette.</p>
 
<p>d) Ability to collect data from instrument, draw graph, interpret and to determine result.</p>
 
<p><b>5.0 Information Input :</b> </p>

<p>1) pH value indicates the strength of H conc. in solution in g ion/lit.</p>
 
<p>2) Strong acid and strong base completely ionizes in water. </p>
 
<p>3) Glass electrode is used in pH meter to determine precise and accurate pH value. </p>
 
<p>4) pH meter should be calibrated using buffer solution before measurement and glass electrode has to be pre-activated. </p>
 
<p>5) Titration should be carried out by careful addition of alkali to the acid.</p>
  
<p>6) The graph is plotted pH Vs volume of base and the nature is S-shaped.</p>
 
<p><b>6.0Apparatus-</b> pH meter, pH meter electrode, burette, pipette, beaker etc.</p>
<p><b>6.1 Chemicals-</b>Sodium hydroxide, HCI / H2SO4, buffer solution (for caliberation of pH-meter) and Indicator.
<p><b>7.0 Procedure-</b> Calibrate the pH meter with the solution of the known pH. Wash the electrode with distilled water. Take 30 ml of strong acid of unknown strength (concentration) in 100ml beaker and dip the electrode in it. Measure the pH of the solution. Then add standard alkali in appropriate amount from the burette and measure the pH after each addition. Take several readings nell above the neutralization point. Plot pH Vs. volume of alkali added. From the graph determine neutralization point.</p>
